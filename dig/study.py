"""dig/study -- read a topic the way the method says: **five papers, one pattern.**

The method the user handed over (2026-09-21) ends like this:

    "Take one paper you have read, then get several similar ones. Compare five or
     more and **find the issue they all keep naming.** That repetition is the point
     -- it is what lets you say in an interview: it used to be done this way, today
     it is done that way, and here is what is still wrong with it."

The pieces for that already exist in this repo -- `dig/openalex` fetches skeletons
and walks references backwards, `dig/fulltext` gets the body where it is open,
`dig/sections` isolates the introduction and background and pulls the sentences
that state a limitation. This module is the assembly, and it is deliberately
**deterministic**: no model is called anywhere in it.

## Why no model

Three reasons, in order of how much they cost us.

  1. The per-minute quota is this bot's actual bottleneck (that is what the whole
     `rpmgate`/`poolpick` work was about). A study run touches 5-30 papers; routing
     that through an LLM would be the single most expensive thing the bot does.
  2. The same topic must give the same answer twice. A ranked list and a word count
     do; a model does not.
  3. There is nothing here a model is needed for. "Which sentences state a
     limitation" is a cue-word question, and "which limitation repeats across five
     papers" is counting.

A model is useful *after* this runs -- to phrase the paragraph you will say out
loud. That is a separate call the human can make, with the evidence in hand.

## What comes out

    papers    each with evidence level (full | abstract | listing) and its
              limitation sentences
    themes    limitation words ranked by **how many distinct papers** name them
              -- not by raw frequency: one wordy paper must not manufacture a theme
    timeline  the reference walk backwards from the most-cited paper
    unread    the papers whose body we could not open, and why

**The unread list is part of the output, not an error.** A pattern found across
five abstracts is weaker than one found across five introductions, and the reader
has to be able to see which they are holding.
