        have anything to do. Gating it off is the single largest dynamic-power lever in
        a digital design. The circuit that does it — the <b>integrated clock-gating
        cell</b> (CGIC) — is a latch followed by an AND, and the latch is not
        optional.</p>
        <p><b>Why the latch.</b> ANDing the enable directly with the clock produces a
        glitch whenever the enable changes while the clock is high: a partial pulse that
        is long enough to be seen by a flop and short enough to violate its minimum
        pulse width. The latch is transparent while the clock is <i>low</i>, so the
        enable can only change during the low phase and is held stable for the whole
        high phase. The gated clock is then always a full pulse or no pulse.</p>
        <p>The clock network of the block assumed here is {플롭수:,} flop clock pins
        plus about {클럭버퍼수():,} buffers — roughly
        {수(1e15*(플롭수*클럭부하+클럭버퍼수()*버퍼부하),4,' fF')} of capacitance
        switching at {수(주파수/1e6,3,' MHz')}, which is
        {수(1e3*클럭전력(),4,' mW')}. Gating it off 60 % of the time saves
        {수(1e3*(클럭전력()-클럭전력(0.6)),4,' mW')}.</p>
        <p><b>Check that against the block, not against itself.</b> T18 assumed the
        whole block draws {수(1e3*블록전력,4,' mW')}. The clock network computed here
        is {수(100*클럭전력()/블록전력,3,' %')} of that &mdash; high, and it should be:
        this is an ungated tree feeding {플롭수:,} flops, which is precisely the design
        that motivates gating. Gating 60 % of it returns
        {수(100*(클럭전력()-클럭전력(0.6))/블록전력,3,' %')} of the whole block's
        power. Had the fraction come out at 5 % or at 90 %, the right response would be
        to distrust the capacitance assumptions rather than to report the saving.</p>""",
