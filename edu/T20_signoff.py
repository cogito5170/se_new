        <p>The economics are a straightforward option price. A full mask set at an
        advanced node costs millions; a metal-only revision costs a fraction of it and
        takes weeks rather than months. Spending 1–2 % of the area on spares is cheap
        insurance if the probability of needing a change is anything but negligible —
