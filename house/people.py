"""house/people -- the five engineers.

These are not people, they are **roles**. They carry names because a report
needs a signatory (the corporate mail template demands one) and because five
reports coming from five different responsibilities should be visible as such
at a glance.

Each person has a `role` (what they are accountable for), `tools` (what they
actually invoke) and `artifacts` (what they leave behind). **The tools column
lists only what really runs in this repository** -- the commercial stack
(VCS, Verdi, DC, ICC2, Tessent, PrimeTime) is not on this machine. We do not
write as if we used something we did not. Instead we build an equivalent
inside the repo and every report states what the measurement was taken with.
